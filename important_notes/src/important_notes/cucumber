 Hooks
 ------
 Cucumber supports hooks, which are blocks of code that run before or after each scenario.
 You can define them anywhere in your project or step definition layers, using the methods 
 @Before and @After. Cucumber Hooks allows us to better manage the code workflow and helps 
 us to reduce code redundancy.
 
 //TAGS :
In Cucumber, tags are annotations that you can apply to features, scenarios, or scenario outlines 
in your feature files. 
 
 Difference btn data table and scenario outline
 -------------------------------------------------
 For example, if you were testing a login system, you might use a data table to test a 
 large number of different username and password combinations. 
 
 //scenrio outlne
 A scenario outline is used when you want to test a single scenario with different data features, scenarios is 
 written with the collaboration of dev,  QA, PO, 
 
 //cu options tag-  link b/w feature file and st def file. it is part of test runner file, 
 with anno @cucumberoptions. it conatins params like feature and glue. f file has the path 
 of f lie and glue has the pat of step def file.
 
 feature file- has high level descrpn of scenarios and steps in gherkin lang, with keyword
 feature
 
 exmple keyword- cn perform dataDrivenTestig using keyword examples. data sets to be taken
  into consideration shall be passed below examples section one after the other seperated 
  by | symbol
  
  //purpose of scenario outline= execute same scenario over multiple values
  
  //bkg keyword - used to define a step or series of steps that are common to all tests
  in the FFile.
  
  //Step dfn file = all keywords used in file are added in step def file. a java extn file
  //contains methods to the feature file
