//Listeners - @Listeners is an interface that modifies tstng behavior.
	//it listens to every event that occurs in the code. If a TC is failed , we need to 
//have a scrnsht of that test case and can be acheived using tstng listeners
//it implements ItestListeners.
//events like mthd start, mthd pass, mthd fail can be cntrld

//hard assert- the assert stmt fails if the actual o/c doesn't matches with the expected o/c
//and the test is halted, remaining tests are skipped. By default in selenium we use hard 
//asserts

//Assertion HardAssert = new Assertion();

//AssertEquals();
//AssertNotEquals();
//AssertTrue();
//AssertFalse();
//AssertSame();
//AssertNotSame();
//AssertNull();
//AssertNotNull();

//settings.xml - file that maintains and holds config of maven proj

//Log4j - using log4j we can generate customized logs. los are the msgs we are recording or
//generating for each transactions we do. we can analyse the logs to check what went correct
//or wrong

//extent reports - to get the reports, present to the team

//@BeforeMethod will be executed before each method within @Test annotation.
//@BeforeTest will be executed before each “test tag” – (<test>) in the TestNG XML file.


//cross platform testing lly - using selenium grid with Testng

//group- specified in testng.xml file under the suite or test tag using @group attribute

//generate reports- right click on prjt and refresh, testng output folder will be there, 
//check for emailabl-report.html. one more indexreport
