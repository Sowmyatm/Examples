// point - metrics to guess how difficult it will be to implement a user story.
//specfied in fib series, 13 is the highest, team assigns story point based on 
//work complexity, amount of time and effort needed.

//TRACEABILITY MATRIX : 
//A traceability matrix is a tool used in project management AND software development,
//It helps in tracing the relationships between different project artifacts, such as requirements, test cases,
//design documents, and code.


//PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE TESTING
//Software testing is a process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets its
//specified requirements

//sprints in 1 release - 4

//manual code coverage- 30-40%
//auto ,, ,, -60-70%

//AGILE AND WATERFALL MODEL :
//Waterfall Model methodology which is also known as Linear Sequential Life Cycle Model. Waterfall Model
//followed in the sequential order,and so project development team only moves to next phase of development 
//or testing if the previous step completed successfully

//Agile methodology is a practice that helps continuous iteration of development and testing in the software
//development process. In this model, development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the Waterfall model. 
//This process allows more communication between customers, developers, managers, and testers.

//user story - description of s/w from end users perspective

//requirement doc- contains all reqs for a certain prod. BA provides it

//how many testcases for each user story - 4-5 with few -vew testcases

//how many testcases for each release - user story *8 =35-40

//agile methodology - it is a f/w
//2 agreements- ready and done
//3 roles- PO, team member, scrum master
//4 artifacts - PO, sprint bcklg(dev team develops),Potentially Shippable prod(psp) -actual
				//prod which is devlpd and burndown chart(sprint burn down)(pros burndown)
//burn down chart - shows the amount of work that has been completed in an epic or sprint, 
//and the total work remaining.
//5 meetings - PBR Prod bck refinmnt - refines items to ready for nxt sprint
				//Sprint planning - wat can be delivered and how work can be acheived
				//standup - start daily meetings to discuss progress
				//review - dealing with past situations
				//retrospective- discussing what went wrong, what can be improved
